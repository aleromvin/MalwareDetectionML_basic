# Alexander Romero Vinogradov's Super-Duper Cool As Heck Original Code of Conduct

This is my code of conduct. This is the code of conduct you WILL follow when contributing, or otherwise engaging, with my projects and my communities. This code of conduct has RULES. These rules are:

1. You do not talk about Fight Club.
2. You do NOT talk about Fight Club.
3. Do not subordinate yourself to absurd codes of conduct.
4. Actually, do whatever you wanna do. Act however you wanna act.
5. But don't cry about it if the way you act gets you banned or otherwise prevents others from being receptive to your efforts of collaborating with them. That's what you get for acting in a way that is annoying.
6. Actually, do cry about it if you want. As I said, do whatever you wanna do.
7. As Mr. Crowley said: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
