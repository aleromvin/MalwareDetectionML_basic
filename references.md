* A learning model to detect maliciousness of portable executable using integrated feature set, by Ajit Kumar, K.S. Kuppusamy and G. Aghila. [Link to the article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319157817300149).

* Ajit Kumar's github repository for the work in his article ([link](https://github.com/urwithajit9/ClaMP)).

* [virusshare.com](virusshare.com), the source of the malicious files I have used to test if my classifiers actually worked (they do... more or less).

* And, of course, immense gratitude to my teacher [Luis Valencia Cabrera](https://github.com/luivalcab/), whose guidance and the curated resources he provided were of immesurable importance for developing this project.
